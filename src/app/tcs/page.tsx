              <br/><br/>
              In the instance that any ambiguity arises in relation to the style of the compendium whatsoever, then it is agreed that John Batman will have discretion as to the style to be provided to the Proprietor at the Establishment and the compendiums provided will be designed and set out, both in terms of appearance and colour, at the complete discretion of John Batman.
